# Colored Petri Net Simulator - Desktop Application

## Description

The Colored Petri Net Simulator is a desktop application designed to help users define, visualize, and simulate Colored Petri Nets (CPNs). It allows users to input the structure of a Petri Net via the console, including places, transitions, and edges, and then provides an interactive graphical interface to visualize and manipulate token movements.

## Features

ðŸ”¹ User-Defined Petri Net Input â€“ The user can specify places (with token counts and colors), transitions, and edges via the console.

ðŸ”¹ Graphical Visualization â€“ The application renders the Petri Net using NetworkX and Matplotlib, displaying places as circles and transitions as squares.

ðŸ”¹ Token Management â€“ Users can add tokens to places dynamically through an interactive UI.

ðŸ”¹ Transition Firing Simulation â€“ The application processes token flow based on Petri Net rules, removing tokens from input places and adding them to output places when a transition fires.

ðŸ”¹ Simple and Interactive UI â€“ A Tkinter-based GUI provides buttons for adding tokens, firing transitions, and updating the simulation.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Updates â€“ Every transition firing updates the graphical representation of the Petri Net.

## Technology Stack
 - Python â€“ Core programming language for logic and simulation.
 - Tkinter â€“ For the graphical user interface.
 - NetworkX & Matplotlib â€“ For visualizing the Petri Net.
 - Console Input Handling â€“ For initial Petri Net configuration.
